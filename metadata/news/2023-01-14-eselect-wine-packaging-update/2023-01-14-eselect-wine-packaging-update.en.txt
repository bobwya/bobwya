This package is currently disabled, temporarily removed
from the ::bobwya Overlay, as it requires a
major re-write to fix: https://bugs.gentoo.org/632576

You are recommended to use ::gentoo:
app-eselect/eselect-wine package in the meantime.
As this package implements a full, working solution
to the bug.
