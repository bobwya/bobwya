    This repository is NVIDIA CUDA plugin for XMRig miner v4.5+ and it adds support for NVIDIA GPUs in XMRig miner.

    The main reasons why this plugin is in a separate project are:

    1. CUDA support is optional, not all users need it, but it is very heavy.
    2. CUDA has very strict compiler version requirements and it may conflict with CPU mining code.
