inxi is a perl-based command line system information tool.
It was forked from infobash, by locsmif. 

inxi is lower case, except when I create a text header here in a file like this, 
but it's always lower case. Sometimes to follow convention I will use upper case 
inxi to start a sentence, but i find it a bad idea since invariably, someone 
will repeat that and type it in as the command name, then someone will copy 
that, and complain that the command: Inxi doesn't exist...

The primary purpose of inxi is for support, and sys admin use. inxi is used 
widely for forum and IRC support, which is I believe it's most common function.

If you are piping output to paste or post (or writing to file), inxi now 
automatically turns off color codes, so the inxi 2.3.xx and older suggestion to 
use -c 0 to turn off colors is no longer required.

inxi strives to be as accurate as possible, but some things, like memory/ram 
data, depend on radically unreliable system self reporting based on OEM filling 
out data correctly, which doesn't often happen, so in those cases, you want to 
confirm things like ram capacity with a reputable hardware source, like 
crucial.com, which has the best ram hardware tool I know of.
