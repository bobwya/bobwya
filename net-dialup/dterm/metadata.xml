  dterm is a simple terminal emulator, which doesn’t actually emulate any particular terminal.
  Mainly, it is designed for use with xterm and friends, which already do a perfectly good
  emulation, and therefore don’t need any special help; dterm simply provides a means by
  which keystrokes are forwarded to the serial line, and data forwarded from the serial
  line appears on the terminal.
